		<section name="Main Reports">
			<p>soapUI Pro Reports are based on the JasperReports reporting engine, and a good understanding of how Jasper works is
			neccessary to customize the reports created by soapUI.</p>
			<p>Reports are technically divided into two categories: <a href="jasperreports.html">main reports</a> and
			<a href="jasper-subreports.html">subreports</a>. Each <a href="jasperreports.html">main report</a> could have one 
			or more <a href="jasper-subreports.html">subreports</a>. All <a href="jasper-subreports.html">subreports</a> in one
			 <a href="jasperreports.html">main report</a> are same <a href="available_reports.html#Report_Types">report type</a>
			  as <a href="jasperreports.html">main report</a>.</p>

			<subsection name="Reporting File System">
				<p>
					Reports are stored in file system and/or project file. Reports
					stored in file system are stored on two places:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>default</b>
							- default reports file system. Its location it is
							$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports and looks like:
							<source> 
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/interface
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/loadtest
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/mockservice
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/monitor
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/project
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/testcase
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/reports/testsuite
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/subreports
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/subreports/loadtest
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/subreports/project
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/subreports/testcase
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/subreports/testsuite
$SOAP_HOME/bin/reports/templates</source>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>custom</b>
							- custom reports file system. This is reserved for user to store
							her reports, subreports, templates and report properties. It
							should have same directory structure like default one. To point
							soapUI Pro to it set path to it in soapUI preferences under
							<b>soapUI Pro</b>
							tab, see picture:

							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Refreshing Reports From File System">
				<p> Once soapUI Pro is started it loads all reports from file
					system. While soapUI Pro is running reports could be changed
					outside soapUI Pro. To updated changes user can force it pressing
					reload button:</p>
