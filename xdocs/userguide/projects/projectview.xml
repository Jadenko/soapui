		<ul>
		<li><b>Overview</b> Gives you an quick overview of your project as well as general project metrics (see below)</li>
		<li><b>TestSuites</b> Allows running of all TestSuites in the project and in soapUI Pro the calculation of 
		Project Coverage allows you to see how much of the interfaces contained in the project that is being covered by tests. This functionality will make you development process more efficient and will increase Test Quality considerably.<a href="coverage.html">Read More</a></li>
		<li><b>Security Configuration</b> the working area for creating WS-Security configurations to be used in Tests, SOAP Monitor or MockServices.<a href="wss.html">Read More</a></li>

		<subsection name="Project Overview Tab">
			<p>
				The Project Overview contains useful information and metrics about your project, such as where files are stored, 
				Test Metrics and MockService Metrics. This is intended as a very quick way of getting information and overview of the project.
				We also have a number of project related inspectors at the bottom of the screen:
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The Description Inspector is a way to write and maintain general information about the Project.
			<p align="center"><img src="images/project_description_insp.gif" border="0"/></p>
			</li>
			<li>The Properties Inspector handles Project level Properties. These properties can be used in levels below the Project.
			<p align="center"><img src="images/project_properties_insp.gif" border="0"/></p></li>
			<li>
			The Load Script Inspector enable you to create Groovy Scripts that runs whenever you open a project. 
			This might be setting Project Properties, synching Project Requirements with external sources and more.
			<p align="center"><img src="images/project_loadscript_insp.gif" border="0"/></p></li>
			<li>
			The Save Script Inspector is the opposite of the Load Script Inspector, it enables you to create Groovy Scripts that runs whenever you <b>close</b> a project. 
			This might be writing data to file, synching Project Requirements with external sources and more.
			<p align="center"><img src="images/project_savescript_insp.gif" border="0"/></p></li>
			<li>
			The Report Script Inspector contains a script that should be run each time a report is generated for the project, read more
			on report scripts and report customization at <a href="reporting/customizing-jasper.html">Report Customization</a>.
